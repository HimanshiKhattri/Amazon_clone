# My First Web Development Project

This project is a front-end clone of Amazon, created to enhance my HTML, CSS skills.<br> I designed layout that replicates the user interface of the Amazon website. <br> including:

- Homepage with featured products, categories and banners.<br>
- Product Listing Page showcasing items.<br>
- Product Detail Pages displaying individual item information with a detailed layout.<br>

# This project helped me strengthen my knowledge of basic <br>design, flex systems, and interactive UI elements. It's <br> a key milestone in my web development journey.
